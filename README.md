# Robot

Here is the code for an autonomous and or rf-controlled robot.

This project was built with minimal soldering.

The robot is intended for educational use in a kindergarten.

The chassis with microcontrollers and parts like the ones described are commonly available as commercial products.

### Parts required for the robot:
1. Arduino (Uno was used)
2. RF24L+(normal RF24 probably works to)
3. L298N motor driver(possible to replace with EasyDriver or something else)
4. Ultra Sonic distance sensor(Many options, most common ones function the same)
5. Servo motor
6. 2 motors with wheels
7. A robot chassis
8. 6 x 1.5 V(AA/LR6) batteries.(Dependeing on the size of the motor)
9. Dupont cables, enough.
  * SensorShield 5.0 is used, it is not needed, but it makes connecting many power wires a breaze.

### Parts required for the robot:
1. Arduino (Nano was used)
2. RF24L+(normal RF24 probably works to)
3. Standard analog joystick.
4. 16 channel multiplexer(74HC4067 on a break-out-board was used,but most of the common ones will work)
5. Buttons(minimum 4 atm, for the menu to work)
6. Nokia 5110 lcd screen(Uses Adafruit grfx and library, should be easy to replace with other adafruit grfx comatible screens.)
7. One 9V(6LR61) Battery
8. Dupont cables, enough.
